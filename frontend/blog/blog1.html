        <h1>Volunteering</h1>

        <p>
            Volunteering is the act of offering time, skills, or services to help others
            without expecting financial rewards. It plays an important role in building
            a compassionate and responsible society.
        </p>

        <p>
            Many social issues such as poverty, lack of education, environmental pollution,
            and healthcare shortages cannot be solved by governments alone. NGOs and
            volunteers together help bridge this gap by working directly with communities.
        </p>

        <p>
            For students, volunteering is not only about helping others but also about
            learning teamwork, leadership, and empathy. Through volunteering platforms,
            individuals can easily find causes they care about and contribute meaningfully
            to society.
