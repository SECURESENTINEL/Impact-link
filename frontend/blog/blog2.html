        <h1> Student Volunteering</h1>

        <p>
           One of the biggest myths about volunteering is that you need prior experience.
            In reality, most NGOs welcome beginners who are willing to learn and help.
        </p>

        <p>
           Volunteering opportunities are designed for people from all backgrounds.
            Tasks such as teaching basics, organizing events, spreading awareness, 
           or helping with data entry require more dedication than experience.
        </p>

        <p>
            NGO volunteering platforms make it easier for first-time volunteers by clearly explaining roles,
             time commitments, and expectations.
             This helps students confidently take their first step toward social work.
