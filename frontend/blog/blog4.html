        <h1>Student Volunteering</h1>

        <p>
            Volunteering helps students grow both personally and professionally.
             It improves communication skills, builds confidence, 
             and develops a sense of responsibility.
        </p>

        <p>
           From a career perspective, volunteering adds value to a resume by showing initiative, teamwork, and social awareness.
            Many employers and universities appreciate candidates who actively contribute to society.

        </p>

        <p>
                By joining volunteering activities through an
                    NGO platform, students can balance academics with
                    social responsibility and gain real-world exposure.
