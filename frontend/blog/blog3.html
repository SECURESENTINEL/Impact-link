        <h1>NGO Awareness</h1>

        <p>
            Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) play a crucial role in
            addressing social problems at the grassroots level.
            They work in areas such as education, women empowerment, healthcare, 
            environmental protection, and rural development.
        </p>

        <p>
            Unlike large institutions, NGOs work closely with
            communities and understand their real needs.
            Volunteers support NGOs by contributing time, skills, and energy,
            helping them expand their reach and impact.
        </p>

        <p>
                An online volunteering platform connects NGOs
                with motivated individuals, making collaboration
                easier and more effective.
